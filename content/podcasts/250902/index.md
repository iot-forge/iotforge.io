description: "The summer break is over and engineers are back at full speed, which means this episode is packed with stories from every corner of IoT. We start with an open-source 3D motion platform that somehow squeezes 50-nanometer precision out of 3D-printed parts and cheap NEMA-17 motors, a perfect showcase of what community engineering can achieve. Then we shift to the microscopic world, where researchers in Slovenia managed to 3D-print a tiny elephant inside a living cell using two-photon polymerization — part science fiction, part science fact. On the more practical side, Bambu Lab has unveiled its biggest single-nozzle printer yet, the H2S, capable of handling engineering plastics with speed and precision, while teasing its colorful future with the wireless H2C system. And to round things out, the latest ESPHome release brings nRF52 support on Zephyr RTOS and ESP-NOW mesh networking, opening new doors for low-power Bluetooth devices and resilient sensor networks. From nanometer motion to home automation, this episode delivers a full spectrum of engineering inspiration."
