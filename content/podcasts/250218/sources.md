#  IoT Forge Unplugged | Smart home trends, AI-powered microcontrollers, IoT security, and the evolving cellular IoT market

Today, we look into Matter, a universal smart home standard, and compare it with the versatile Home Assistant platform. We also dive into STMicroelectronics' STM32N6 microcontroller, designed to bring AI capabilities to real-time data processing at the edge. Next up, we discuss a massive data breach at Mars Hydro and its implications for IoT security. Finally, we review the current state of the cellular IoT module market, analyzing its growth and challenges.
