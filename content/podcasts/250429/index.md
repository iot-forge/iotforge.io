description: "In this episode of IoT Forge Unplugged, we explores the edge of innovation — from a full-stack Golioth Cloud demo and Reolink’s seamless Home Assistant integration, to Arduino’s eco-friendly PCB initiative and Hugging Face’s leap into open-source robotics. Plus, what happens when humanoid robots try to run a marathon (spoiler: it's not pretty), and how old Roombas are being transformed into clever household helpers."
