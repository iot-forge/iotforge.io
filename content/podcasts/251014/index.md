description: "In this episode of IoT Forge News Digest, we dive into a surprising headline — Qualcomm acquires Arduino. What happens when the world’s simplest microcontroller brand meets one of the most complex chip ecosystems? We talk about the friction, the potential, and the future of the maker scene. Then, we shift gears to robotics research — from tireless task-specific machines to humanoids learning not just what objects are, but how they’re meant to be used. It’s about moving from recognition… to understanding.Tune in, think, and maybe — blink twice if you’re curious about where IoT and robotics are heading next."
