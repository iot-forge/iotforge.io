description: "In this episode we move far beyond the hobby corner of 3D printing. From LAIKA’s Oscar-winning “replacement animation” technique, to surgeons rehearsing operations on 3D-printed heads, to the wild world of five-axis printers and Arduino’s big bet on ZephyrOS — the frontier of making is shifting again. We’ll also peek into the latest Home Assistant release, where AI moves from novelty into full-blown automation."
