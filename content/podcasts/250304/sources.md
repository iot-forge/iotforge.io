# IoT Forge Unplugged | IoT Evolves: Smarter Hardware, Smarter Networks, Smarter Future

In this episode of IoT Forge Unplugged, we dive into the upgraded ESP32-C2 and where it fits in real-world applications, the latest ESPHome update with expanded audio support, and whether I³C really improves on I²C’s distance limitations. Plus, we explore EdgeAI for predictive maintenance, energy harvesting for Ambient IoT, and how Arduino and Silicon Labs are making Matter and machine learning more accessible. Finally, we break down concurrent multiprotocols — why they matter and who should explore them.
