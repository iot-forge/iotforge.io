description: "In Episode 15 of the IoT Forge News Digest, we journey into the wilder side of robotics and IoT. From swarms of insect-brained drones zipping through cluttered spaces, to hissing cockroaches turned into first-responder cyborgs, to robots learning to understand their own bodies—autonomy is evolving in unexpected ways. We revisit the self-modeling robot research we covered in Episode 12 and explore why giving robots a “sense of self” is becoming a hot topic in the field. Plus, we wrap up with a real-world smart home showcase from the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, where Home Assistant proves that local-first automation is king."
