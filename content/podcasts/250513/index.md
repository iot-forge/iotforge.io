description: "We’ll talk about robots that can be tricked by language alone—yes, even the physical ones that move and grab. We’ll look at a new robot from Amazon that can actually *feel* what it touches. After that, we’ll jump into the world of 3D printing—both inside the human body and outside, with massive walls printed in just hours. And finally, there’s a cool new product from M5Stack that I’m seriously thinking about getting, even though my workbench is already full of half-finished projects."
