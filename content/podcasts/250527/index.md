description: "In this episode of IoT Forge Unplugged News Digest, we take you on a journey from the fields of smart agriculture to the burning front lines of wildfire robotics — exploring how small ideas, when localized and scaled, reshape the landscape of IoT. We cover the new Packet Transport feature in ESPHome and how it transforms sensor networks in the field, dive into a DIY LoRa-powered soil monitor that spans a kilometer, and look at a custom remote that’s smarter than the TV it controls. Plus: a look at The Guardian — a robot built for wildland firefighting, and some quick updates from Homey Pro mini and SmartThings Dev Portal. If you’re an engineer, tinkerer, or tech-savvy manager — this one’s packed with practical insight, architectural ideas, and a glimpse into the near future of embedded intelligence."
