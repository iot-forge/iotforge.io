# IoT Forge Unplugged | Robotics and medical, manufacturing and food industries.

For this episode, I want to focus on something more specific in one area, as opposed to covering a wide variety of news. Recently, I came across a couple of news stories and articles about robotics and their role in different areas. I want to highlight three particular cases: medical, manufacturing, and food. And to start a new tradition, every odd episode I will include a few observations from the personal projects I’m working on — stay tuned to learn how to use fewer microcontrollers to make life easier.
