description: "In this episode, we explore the Peripheral Reflex System (PRS) — a hidden gem inside Silicon Labs chips that enables ultra-low-power, high-speed hardware reactions without waking the CPU. We look at Raspberry Pi’s new $4 certified radio module that can save you thousands in wireless certification costs, and meet Walter — a powerful ESP32-S3 + 5G module built for cellular-connected IoT in the field. Finally, we dive into Home Assistant 2025.7, with its redesigned tablet-friendly dashboards, fully local conversational voice assistant, and cleaner, modular device integration."
