# IoT Forge Unplugged | From Arduinoâ€™s 20th Anniversary to AI-Powered Robotics 

We celebrate Arduino's 20th anniversary, reflecting on its impact and future. Next, we explore Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics project, which is integrating advanced AI into robotic hardware.

We then discuss Home Assistant's major updates: the expanded Music Assistant and official Matter certification, both of which enhance its position in the smart home space. Lastly, we delve into the creative world of circuit bending, where hackers turn everyday devices into unique musical instruments.
