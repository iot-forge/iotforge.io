  description: “Showcasing the stories of the people who make technology a force for
    good in the world” Technology can be a force for good in the world. But it’s a
    tool. And, like any tool, it’s down to the user to decide how to use it. In the
    right hands, it can feed the hungry, save lives and build a better future. Here
    at 5V media, we’re on a mission to showcase the stories of those who are making
    technology a force for good. This ranges from the founders driving their own venture,
    the incubators facilitating innovation, the engineers on the ground creating solutions
    to the world’s challenges, right up to the researchers who are continually pushing
    the boundaries of what’s possible within tech. We tell their stories through our
    leading podcasts, conferences, and video series.
