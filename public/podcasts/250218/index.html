            <p>Hey everyone, and welcome to <em>IoT Forge Unplugged</em>! Every two weeks, we dive into the latest and most intriguing happenings in the world of IoT with this bite-sized podcast, breaking down key updates and emerging trends.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear from you—whether it’s feedback, story suggestions (because, let’s be real, my picks often align with my own interests), or just sparking discussions within the community.</p>
<p>So, let’s jump in! Today is February 18th, and this is our fourth episode of 2025.</p>

<h2 id="home-assistant-smarter-smart-homes">Home Assistant: Smarter Smart Homes?</h2>
<p>The first thing that caught my attention was a video from <em>Snazzy Labs</em>, where the host outlines four key principles for building a smart home: (1) devices must function manually, (2) control should be centralized, (3) devices must be locally controllable without reliance on external servers, and (4) automation should never interfere unexpectedly.</p>
<p>These principles have remained solid over the years, but the smart home landscape has evolved significantly—especially with the introduction of <em>Matter</em>, a universal smart home standard.</p>
<p>Matter aims to ensure cross-platform compatibility, allowing devices to work seamlessly across Apple, Google, Alexa, and SmartThings ecosystems. It runs on local networking via IPv6 and supports communication through Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Thread, a low-power mesh network. However, while Matter simplifies connectivity, real-world adoption is inconsistent, with different ecosystems integrating updates at varying speeds.</p>
<p>One major drawback? Matter doesn’t require full adoption of all its features, leading to fragmented support. For example, a dishwasher might work with Amazon but not Apple, while a robot vacuum could be compatible only with select platforms. Multi-admin support <em>theoretically</em> allows devices to be shared across ecosystems, but missing features and manual setup make it clunky.</p>
<p>Despite Matter’s potential, <em>Home Assistant</em> remains the more powerful and flexible choice. It already supports the latest Matter updates while integrating non-Matter devices and enabling advanced features like camera streaming. Unlike closed ecosystems, Home Assistant is open-source, community-driven, and ensures long-term support.</p>
<p>While Matter is pushing the industry toward better compatibility, it remains a work in progress. If you want full control over your smart home, Home Assistant is still the best bet.</p>
<p>You can find the link to the video in the podcast description.</p>

<h2 id="now-lets-talk-about-the-growing-need-for-ai-at-the-edge-as-iot-devices-become-more-powerful-the-demand-for-real-time-data-processing-is-skyrocketing-enter-the-stm32n6a-microcontroller-designed-to-bring-ai-capabilities-to-embedded-systems-but-is-it-the-right-choice-for-your-next-project">Now let’s talk about the growing need for AI at the edge. As IoT devices become more powerful, the demand for real-time data processing is skyrocketing. Enter the STM32N6—a microcontroller designed to bring AI capabilities to embedded systems. But is it the right choice for your next project?</h2>
<p>The IoT world just got a major upgrade with the launch of the <em>STM32N6</em>, STMicroelectronics’ most powerful microcontroller yet. This Neural Processing Unit (NPU)-accelerated MCU is designed for applications like robotics, drones, and AI inference at the edge. But is it a game-changer or overkill for most IoT projects?</p>
<h3 id="why-the-stm32n6-stands-out">Why the STM32N6 Stands Out</h3>
<p>This is the first STM32 MCU featuring ST&rsquo;s <em>Neural-ART Accelerator™</em>, a 1GHz machine-learning engine delivering up to 600 GOPS with an average of 3 TOPS for AI tasks. That means real-time computer vision, audio processing, and even H.264 video encoding—powered by a Cortex-M55 running at 800 MHz with 4.2MB embedded RAM.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;600 GOPS at an average of 3 TOPS&rdquo; might seem contradictory at first, but it likely refers to different types of operations. GOPS might be for general-purpose operations, while TOPS could be specific to AI-related workloads (e.g., tensor processing, matrix operations, or neural network inference).</p>
<p>It also packs high-speed interfaces like MIPI CSI-2, Hexa-SPI, and Octo-SPI, making it highly adaptable for AI-driven embedded systems, wearables, and industrial automation.</p>
<h3 id="the-drawbacks">The Drawbacks</h3>
<p>However, despite its raw power, the STM32N6 isn’t ideal for every IoT project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Built-in Wi-Fi:</strong> Unlike the ESP32, which includes wireless connectivity, the STM32N6 requires an external module.</li>
<li>It’s <strong>power-hungry</strong> compared to ultra-low-power chips like the nRF52.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Cost &amp; Complexity</strong>: The STM32N6 is great for AI-heavy applications, but simpler IoT projects might benefit from something cheaper and easier to develop, like the ESP32 or nRF52. Pricing starts at $20 per unit, but bulk orders of 1,000 or more bring the cost down to under $10 per unit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-should-use-it">Who Should Use It?</h3>
<p>This microcontroller is perfect for:</p>
<p>✔️ Autonomous drones &amp; robots<br>
✔️ Smart security cameras<br>
✔️ AI-powered healthcare wearables<br>
✔️ Automotive sensor fusion &amp; Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems.</p>
<p>For traditional IoT applications requiring low power and built-in Wi-Fi, you’re still better off with the ESP32 or nRF52.</p>
<h3 id="final-verdict">Final Verdict</h3>
<p>The STM32N6 pushes the boundaries of embedded AI but won’t replace the ESP32 or nRF52 in every scenario. If your project requires real-time AI at the edge, it’s a game-changer—otherwise, you might want to stick with more cost-effective options.</p>
<p>Would you use the STM32N6? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<h2 id="iot-security-mars-hydros-data-leak-raises-alarms">IoT Security: Mars Hydro’s Data Leak Raises Alarms</h2>
<p>The next topic will be relevant any time: no matter if there won’t be any announcement of new chips or cloud-based IoT hubs. The &ldquo;S&rdquo; letter in &ldquo;IoT&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Security,&rdquo; and this is the next topic I want to shed light on:</p>
<p>Cybersecurity researcher <em>Jeremiah Fowler</em> recently uncovered a major data exposure—2.7 billion records tied to <em>Mars Hydro</em>, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT-enabled grow lights. The unprotected database, totaling 1.17 terabytes, contained Wi-Fi credentials, IP addresses, device details, and API logs.</p>
<p>The exposed database, seemingly linked to <em>LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED</em>, raises significant privacy and security concerns. Despite responsible disclosure efforts, Mars Hydro was initially unresponsive before eventually confirming the leak originated from its <em>Mars Pro</em> app. It remains unclear how long the data was exposed or if malicious actors accessed it.</p>
<h3 id="wider-iot-security-concerns">Wider IoT Security Concerns</h3>
<p>This breach highlights ongoing security risks in IoT, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak encryption</li>
<li>Default credentials</li>
<li>Outdated software</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsecured Wi-Fi credentials can enable &ldquo;nearest neighbor attacks,&rdquo; where hackers gain network access to manipulate smart devices or launch botnet attacks.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-future-incidents">Preventing Future Incidents</h3>
<p>Experts urge IoT manufacturers to:</p>
<p>✅ Implement stronger encryption<br>
✅ Restrict public access to cloud storage<br>
✅ Conduct regular security audits</p>
<p>While there’s no evidence of wrongdoing by Mars Hydro, this incident underscores the urgent need for better security across IoT ecosystems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cellular-iot-market-growth-challenges-and-the-future">Cellular IoT Market: Growth, Challenges, and the Future</h2>
<p>To the next topic:
The cellular IoT module market has hit a rough patch. While the industry is expanding, some vendors have seen sales drop by <em>50%</em> since 2023.  And what’s the reason behind this downturn? Companies stockpiled modules during the <em>2021–2022 chip shortage</em> and are still burning through that inventory, leading to a slowdown in new sales.</p>
<h3 id="winners-and-losers">Winners and Losers</h3>
<p><em>Quectel</em> is thriving due to its ability to diversify revenue streams in automotive and broadband, allowing it to stay ahead in the market. Meanwhile, <em>u-blox</em> has completely exited the IoT module business, choosing to shift focus to other technologies. At the same time, <em>Unionman</em> is gaining traction in China, though its influence on the global market remains limited.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-large-scale-deployments">The Rise of Large-Scale Deployments</h3>
<p>Despite vendor struggles, large-scale IoT projects are booming:</p>
<p>Automotive leads the way with 230 million active connections, powering everything from vehicle tracking to autonomous systems. The utilities sector follows closely with 139 million smart meters, playing a crucial role in energy management. Meanwhile, transport and logistics contribute 100 million connections, enhancing fleet tracking, cargo monitoring, and supply chain efficiency.</p>
<p>The market is expected to reach <em>1 billion</em> cellular IoT connections by 2028, growing at an average rate of 10.7% per year from now until 2028.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>
<p>What’s next? The future of cellular IoT will be shaped by several key factors. Next-generation networks like 5G will create a clear divide between companies that innovate and those that struggle to keep up. Businesses that diversify across multiple IoT sectors will have a greater chance of thriving in this competitive market. Additionally, as demand shifts, the ability to scale internationally will become increasingly crucial for success.</p>
