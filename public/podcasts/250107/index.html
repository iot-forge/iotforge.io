            <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to IoT Forge!</p>
<p>Every week, we pick the most exciting news from the world of IoT to
share with you. Starting this week, we&rsquo;re adding a short podcast to
accompany our updates, where I&rsquo;ll dive into the stories and share my
thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to get involved &ndash; send in your feedback, suggest news I
might have missed (since my interests are shaped by my hobbies), and
join the discussions around these topics.</p>
<p>So, today is January 7, 2025. Happy holidays to everyone! Let&rsquo;s kick
things off with today&rsquo;s big story &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s Proxima chip!</p>
<p>Proxima</p>
<p>So, Apple is working on its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, codenamed
Proxima. This is huge because it could completely shift Apple&rsquo;s smart
home game. The chip is supposed to roll out later this year in updated
versions of the Apple TV and HomePod mini. What&rsquo;s exciting here is that
Apple is moving away from relying on Broadcom for these components. If
you&rsquo;ve been paying attention, this fits right into Apple&rsquo;s whole &ldquo;do
everything in-house&rdquo; strategy &ndash; like they&rsquo;ve done with the M-series
chips for Macs.</p>
<p>Proxima will be made by TSMC, and it&rsquo;s designed to make Apple devices
sync better, use less power, and support the new Wi-Fi 6E standard.
Sounds like a win, right? But there&rsquo;s a catch. First-gen chips usually
aren&rsquo;t perfect, so matching Broadcom&rsquo;s performance right out of the gate
might be tough. That said, long-term, this gives Apple way more control
over its wireless tech.</p>
<p>And Apple isn&rsquo;t stopping there &ndash; they&rsquo;re also reportedly working on an
AI-powered, wall-mounted home hub. Think of it like a super-smart
command center for your house. If they nail this, it could make Apple a
bigger player in the smart home space, where, let&rsquo;s be honest, they&rsquo;ve
lagged a bit compared to Google and Amazon.</p>
<p>But this move is already making waves. Broadcom&rsquo;s stock took a hit
because Apple makes up 20% of their revenue. They&rsquo;ll still work together
on other projects, but clearly, Apple&rsquo;s building an exit strategy.</p>
<p>Now, zooming out, Proxima could open doors for thinner devices, new
wearables, and maybe even a standalone security camera. This isn&rsquo;t just
about smart homes; it&rsquo;s about Apple shaping the future of its entire
ecosystem. If Proxima delivers, it could be a game-changer for the way
we connect everything in our lives.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is Apple&rsquo;s move bold, risky, or both? Let me know,
and we&rsquo;ll keep this conversation going!</p>
<p>NBIoT</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk IoT connectivity &ndash; straight from space!</p>
<p>Mavenir and Terrestar Solutions (TSI) just completed their first live
NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) data sessions using the TSI Echostar T1
satellite. Unlike lab tests, these trials were conducted in real-world
conditions in Ontario, proving the system&rsquo;s reliability and readiness
for widespread use with standard IoT devices.</p>
<p>The satellite operates in Geostationary Earth Orbit as part of a
Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN), tackling the age-old challenge of
providing mobile coverage in hard-to-reach areas. Key features like
24-hour connectivity, paging, and Non-IP Data Delivery were tested
successfully, using a custom Radio Access Network (RAN) by Mavenir.</p>
<p>To accelerate innovation, the two companies opened a Montreal lab,
dedicated to scaling satellite-based IoT solutions. Powered by Mavenir&rsquo;s
tech on AWS, it&rsquo;s designed for seamless collaboration and large-scale
deployments.</p>
<p>This milestone highlights how Non-Terrestrial Networks can enhance
traditional networks, delivering cost-effective, universal
coverage &ndash; critical as IoT adoption explodes globally.</p>
<p>While reading this news, I came across the term &ldquo;paging,&rdquo; something I
hadn&rsquo;t looked into before. Curious, I dug deeper, and here&rsquo;s what I
found &ndash; it&rsquo;s actually a fascinating and critical part of how IoT devices
communicate efficiently! Let me share the details with you.</p>
<p>In the context of IoT and mobile networks, paging refers to the process
by which a network locates and establishes communication with a specific
device, such as an IoT module or mobile device, that is in a low-power
or idle state.</p>
<p>Key Points About How It Works:</p>
<p>• When the network needs to send data or a notification to a device, it
broadcasts a &ldquo;paging message&rdquo; to the cell or coverage area where the
device was last registered.</p>
<p>• The device, even in its idle state, periodically listens for these
paging messages to save power.</p>
<p>2. Why It&rsquo;s Important for IoT:</p>
<p>• Many IoT devices (e.g., sensors, trackers) operate in low-power states
to conserve battery life. Paging allows these devices to remain
reachable without staying in active communication with the network.</p>
<p>• Efficient paging ensures reliable communication with devices while
minimizing power consumption &ndash; a critical factor for IoT applications.</p>
<p>• For non-terrestrial networks (like the TSI Echostar T1), paging
ensures that IoT devices in remote or hard-to-reach areas can be
contacted even if they are not constantly transmitting data.</p>
<p>• It&rsquo;s a vital feature for applications like remote monitoring, where
devices might need to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; only when specific data or alerts are
required.</p>
<p>In the trials conducted by Mavenir and Terrestar, successful paging
demonstrated that their satellite-based network could reliably locate
and wake IoT devices under real-world conditions, a major step toward
making the system practical for widespread use.</p>
<p>Could satellite IoT be the key to universal connectivity? Let me know
your thoughts!</p>
<p>NVIDIA</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the NVIDIA® Jetson Orin™ Nano Super Developer Kit &ndash; an
affordable powerhouse for IoT and edge computing!</p>
<p>Priced at just $250, this developer kit packs impressive AI
performance, making it perfect for edge computing tasks like real-time
video analytics, robotics, or smart IoT devices. It allows developers to
build and test solutions that leverage the power of AI and machine
learning without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>NVIDIA envisions a seamless path where you prototype on this board and
later collaborate with them to manufacture a full-scale product. Sounds
great, right? But there&rsquo;s a catch &ndash; NVIDIA struggles to keep up with
demand. Long queues and extended waiting times for production orders can
significantly delay your project timeline, especially if you&rsquo;re looking
to scale quickly.</p>
<p>So while the Orin Nano Super Developer Kit is a fantastic entry point
for innovation, its practicality for production needs careful
consideration, especially given NVIDIA&rsquo;s current supply constraints.
It&rsquo;s a great tool to start with but not a silver bullet for every IoT
project!</p>
<p>Arduino schematic</p>
<p>From news, let&rsquo;s shift gears to a personal project!</p>
<p>Recently, I finally got around to setting up virtual walls for my robot
vacuum. To do this, I decided to repurpose some old Arduino Uno boards
that had been collecting dust. For power, I planned to use a 9-volt
battery, but before diving in, I hit the internet to double-check if
that was within the official power specs for the Arduino Uno.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I stumbled upon an incredibly detailed article breaking down
the Arduino Uno&rsquo;s circuit design at a very low level. The article dives
into the schematic, explaining each section of the board and the
concepts behind its design. It&rsquo;s a fascinating read if you&rsquo;re curious
about how these boards work under the hood.</p>
<p>I found the article super educational and would highly recommend it to
anyone looking to deepen their understanding of PCB design. While it&rsquo;s
not a full replacement for formal learning, it&rsquo;s a great way to spark
your interest and might even motivate you to learn more about
electronics.</p>
<p>RPI GPIO and Arduino Cloud</p>
<p>Ok lets finish with an article from the Arduino Project Hub: how to
Control your Raspberry Pi GPIOs from Arduino Cloud using Node.js /
Javascript</p>
<p>Building on our last discussion about edge computing and the powerful
tools available for IoT development, this project using Raspberry Pi
GPIOs, Arduino Cloud, and Node.js offers a great way to dive into
hands-on IoT. Just like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Kit lets you play
around with edge computing, this setup lets you control your Raspberry
Pi&rsquo;s GPIO pins from a cloud dashboard &ndash; an easy way to get started with
cloud-enabled IoT solutions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable and practical way to extend your IoT
skills, I highly recommend trying out this tutorial. It&rsquo;s simple, fun,
and gives you a real feel for building interactive applications. The
best part? It helps you experiment with cloud integration and real-time
control, similar to what we discussed with edge devices.</p>
<p>And that wraps up today&rsquo;s episode! I hope you found the discussions
useful and that they sparked some inspiration for your own projects.
Remember, this podcast is all about you, so please don&rsquo;t hesitate to
send in any news, participate in the discussions, or leave feedback.
It&rsquo;s always great to hear what&rsquo;s on your mind!</p>
<p>Also, a quick reminder: finding fresh, valuable news in the IoT world
isn&rsquo;t always easy, and I also try to avoid overlap with our biweekly
IoTuesday brown bag sessions. But I promise we&rsquo;ll be back in two weeks
with more news and articles, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>And hey, if you haven&rsquo;t joined IoT Forge yet, what are you waiting for?
It&rsquo;s a great way to learn, share, and connect with others in the
community. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with that!</p>
<p>Until next time, take care and keep building! Cheers!</p>
